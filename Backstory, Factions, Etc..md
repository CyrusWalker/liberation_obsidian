Target max company size of 12-20 constrained by costs, if you can’t pay them they leave.

How about this combination of ideas from our 12/8 lunch meeting?  It focuses variables by having only the one faction you can truly align with, but allows for the “work for anybody” mercenary mechanic.  One does not preclude the other unless you torpedo your standing with the Indig based on the contracts you take.  BUT, the thing I tried to resolve here is there is still a “win state” or end game that plays out whether we align with our faction or just optimize for our company’s performance. So …

*****

Our entry  into the AO is being hired by Indig for a seemingly straightforward defense of a village and what we think is simply farmland from a single enemy (the first faction to show up in the game).  That takes a few missions to secure various spots, defeat certain units, defend against an assault and ultimately handle the captain of the enemy unit.  Success, right?  No, just the beginning.  

Through these first few missions, talks with the locals, interrogations of enemy we learn of the overall plot … the research on the fungal spores, that this first faction is only one of several that want to control the resource for their own purposes, and that there is a multi-party conflict brewing here that is going to represent A LOT of opportunity.  Now, we begin cutting our way through this plot to either ensure the “right” faction wins in our view or make a fortune while they all vie against each other.

In the background there is a scoring system of how the factions are performing.  There is a certain number of points that represents a “win state’ for whatever faction reaches it first.  We can help any faction win or lose points by taking missions for them or against them … or we can prolong the money making by keeping them all balanced.  There are “Events” happening in the background that shape those faction dynamics (like Xcom, I guess?).  Some are playable – often, through intelligence or black market/job board postings we will know that two factions are engaging and we can choose to take a contract to help or hurt one or the other (like Battletech).   

If we don’t participate, the events/battles play out in the background; we could even randomly resolve which faction won that battle and how that shapes faction points vs having it be pre-determined.  

To narrow variables for this first playthrough, the only faction you can truly ally with to get plot and game-related benefits are the Indig … IF you achieve and maintain a certain affinity with them.  But, you don’t have to.  The rest are effectively clients to be monetized or manipulated.  

**Faction Relation:**
Some events/quests are small (this battle is +10 to winner / -10 to loser), others are big (this assault/defense engagement is +100/-100 and can really change the balance).  Faction unit strength/resources (and their ability to pay us) depends on their score.  Could expose this in terms of a colored arrow?  Green up, Red down?

Faction relationship would allow the mercs to access better tech from them, hire their units, get things cheaper.

**Power Level:**
Hidden or alluded to through communications, news-paper articles, etc. Certain events throughout the game (missions the mercs take, or time-boxed events) add or reduce power level for factions.  When a faction reaches a certain break-point this triggers the end-state.

Either way, there is an “end state” we are all headed toward.  Any faction could win based on the automated events and background scoring.  It’s just a matter of how much our team influences things along the way, how much money we make doing it, and how badass the team is by the end.

<ins>I have a proposal on timeframe/era for your consideration.  1989.</ins>

Sounds like a few of us like the idea of it having an era to give it atmosphere and maybe even specifically the 80s/90s vibe.  I think ‘89 offers a neat “how/why is this huge discovery and mobilization kept secret from the world and only a few parties vying for it”.  In ‘89 there were plenty of HUGE distractions … fall of the Berlin Wall, Exxon Valdez spill, US invades Panama, huge earthquake hits San Francisco, China Tiananmen Square protest, Iran Contra investigation.  In fact, it might be cheeky to suggest that some of these were ‘manufactured’ as distraction to hide efforts to capture the huge discovery on this remote island/region..  Even if we don’t do that, it could be neat little mechanic in the game to have the team seeing news or hearing headlines when at base to give an atmosphere of all this history happening at the same time and maybe also to represent the passage of time throughout the year?

**Backstory Concept for Discussion:**

In the waters of the Pacific lies a network of small islands that make up the Matvia Archipelago, the “ownership” of which has often been contested by various parties over time.  (Think like Philippines or Micronesia, anywhere where there are soooo many islands any one could get minimal attention or be adjacent to so many that sovereignty could occasionally shift or be debated.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_in_the_Pacific_Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_in_the_Pacific_Ocean) )  

But now Matvia is getting the quiet-but-serious attention of certain world powers that have learned the value of recent discoveries there.  Unveiled initially by a team of scientists studying the impact of changing climate on small ecosystems, a kind of fungal spore promises miracles ranging from mind control to pharmacological elixirs to next gen narcotics.  Or so the powers believe.*  The research is incomplete because as the scientists first draft report was being prepared, the team suddenly went missing in suspected foul play (Are they dead or are they hiding?)

These few powers have already done much to keep these discoveries and their subversive work out of the headlines, but they each now aim to capture either the data, the spores or the land itself to not only serve their own security and economic interests but perhaps to guide the very shape of the future.

And, upending the balance of power in this isolated, quiet war is our small but mighty mercenary company.

\* Depending on how plot-twisty (or cynical) we want to get, maybe an irony we build toward at the end is none of these things are true and that all these ambitions were misguided?  Maybe we find the scientists and get the “truth”?

Whichever faction you side with most will become the villain.  When the ‘big reveal’ takes place, unlocks the end-game/win condition.

Use a newspaper pop-up style to reference the broader world events and the specific things the game needs.

END GAME:
Power level determines which faction will exhibit the ‘bad outcome’ (see below).  That triggers a big reveal moment that then opens the endgame mission set.  Methodology to spread the spores is faction dependent.  Chynastan - put it in cheap plastic toys, Humanico - Habisco additive distribution, United Alliance - push it into the illegal drug manufacturing processes to keep the war on drugs going indefinitely, Indigenous Forces - dormant volcano to spread it

<ins>Three missions to complete</ins>

1. Find the bad guy and get the intel from him - Dr. No etc.
2. Fight to get away from him or to get to the end point
3. Stop the bad thing mission


New Faction Notes Based on 80s/90s Theme:

**Indigenous Forces:   

The Matvians have long understood the medicinal and spiritual benefits of the fungal spore, if dried and processed just so.  In fact, the scientists didn’t so much discover it as just observe it from the Matvians.  They are simple and tribal, but not entirely unexposed to the modern world … enough to understand the agenda of men.  Their goal is to defend their land and keep the world-changing benefits of the spores out of the hands of outsiders.   

For gameplay, the challenge is how to make the Matvians viable against modern forces in a way we can buy into.  Proposed capabilities of this faction are they fight like indigenous guerillas; they know the lands and have tunnel systems (think Vietcong?); they strike/ambush and disappear; they plant traps; they spy and know enemy routes and locations.  If we are willing to take a less realistic path, maybe they have trained animals (bears tank for them, falcons take out drones, etc)?  Or if we lean into more of a Shaman vibe, maybe some can use the spores to fight in some spiritual or mind control way to turn enemies against each other?  Perks of alliance with this faction are best intel on maps and enemy, access to “safe houses” from which to launch missions more covertly or to retreat to for healing/hiding if a mission goes sideways, ability to call in limited reinforcements that are in close proximity and therefore quick.

Ecoterrorist, turns people into plants?  Culty outcome, everyone becomes subservient to the shaman

**Chynastan:  

The Matvia Archipelago sits far, far off the coast of Chynastan, but the continental power has claimed dominion over some of the islands when it suits them.  And, it does now.  Chynastan is not an advanced world power, in fact in general they oppose science and technology as unnatural … except again when it suits them.  What Chynastan has is raw numbers, hordes of zealots, that attack in waves.  It has long been rumored that the regime uses some form of chemical treatment or aggressive indoctrination to “motivate” and control these wild-eyed assaulters.  Their goal is to master the more effective mind altering potential of the spores to ensure the “cooperative and productive” life of all people, which is either world peace or slavery.

For gameplay this faction might feel most like zombies or like vermintide or deep rock.  When it comes to capabilities, their equipment is basic but plentiful regarding weapons, food, ammo, ground transport.  They have limited medical capabilities out of philosophy and because people are an unlimited resource.  They have limited tech and weak tech security.  Perks of alliance with this faction are very inexpensive team hires, plentiful basic equipment, and limited artillery support (but this presents risk too because they don’t much care about “danger close” engagements).

Zombie worker/soldiers/citizens no sense of individuality (Ants)

**United Alliance:  

A coalition of western governments (think NATO) needs to ensure this miracle does not end up in the wrong hands, which are any hands but theirs.  But, after recent world events, political “mis-steps” and existing military engagements, they are sure the people and press of the West have little appetite for another war.  So, the UA calls on its answer for any op-on-the-downlow: special forces.  They’ll ally with and recruit the locals, if they can, but the goal is to ensure whatever this resource is, it belongs to the duly elected leaders of the West and not the zealots of the region or soulless corporate pirates.  Plus, after watching the Iran Contra thing and seeing how hopeless the War on Drugs is, the UA commander ain’t exactly blind to opportunity for a little spore distribution scheme on the side.

From a gameplay perspective, the capabilities of this faction include small, but heavily armed and armored A-teams.  They have the best weapons and nearly super-human troops.  They have the best tactics (use of cover, etc) and will aid a teammate when down (think drag to cover or render aid so a teammate can get back in the fight).  They also have the best air assets, including choppers for quick deployments and extractions.  Perks of alliance with this faction are access to powerful weapons and armor, access to elite team, access to air support including rare-but-precise jet airstrikes and medevacs.

Dick Cheney type that has ulterior motive  

The drug processed version of the spores, eventually turns users into sociopathic killers/CEOs/Tech Bros.  Murder rates jump but mostly unsolved.

**HumaniCo:  

Run by tech billionaire Gil Bates, HumaniCo is his non-profit with a mission to provide R&D and resources to advance “humanitarian” objectives.  It also serves as an offshore tax haven for his wealth and an unregulated playground to explore pet tech projects, all under the feel-good flag of charity.  HumaniCo clearly does not have its own army.  But what it does have is the most advanced technology any battlefield has yet seen.  Bates’ goal is to secure the intellectual property behind the spores – via friendly licensing with the locals or sabotage or force – to monopolize and monetize the multibillion dollar medical potential.

For gameplay, this faction’s capabilities feature heavily armored mini-tanks for strong defense and remotely controlled RC helicopters for recon and air strikes.  But, it’s the 80s, so these are not AI; they all require a commander in near proximity to control them, who are vulnerable if you can spot them.  They also have elite hackers and limited EMP tech to disrupt the communication and electronics of foes.  This faction has the most advanced comms and tech security.  Their assets are expert, small in number, but very expensive.  Perks of alliance with this faction include pretty good field/map intel (due to air assets), very good deciphering and hacking resources, occasional air support via drones, and better financial backing than other factions.

<ins>Appendix:  Original Faction Notes That Assumed More “Near Future” Timeline:</ins>

Was exploring the notion of factions more, with an angle on making each feel different but also what Ben said about “by the time you figure out the AI limitations of this one thing, we throw something different at you”.  Was also thinking about what Jake asked (I think it was Jake) re: what’s our unique twist on shooter to give it’s own personality/differentiation … besides the meta/strategic elements outside combat (which I think is already a good start).  Below are nicknames to get across concepts not actual proposals.  As usual, all below is just to fuel discussion of ideas better than these.  Don’t let me riff on all this alone bc I’m digging it pretty hard and don’t want to roll over the group with ideas. 

United Alliance:  A coalition of western governments (think NATO) that wants the resource but the populace doesn’t have the stomach to lose a lot of people in a “real” war (you know, like every war since Vietnam).  So, maybe smaller, but heavy (and slower) forces, automated ground bots (think Boston Dynamics, guns on treaded mini-tanks, etc), some human “leaders” or controllers embedded.  These engagements are more dug in, heavy exchanges or using geography (mud, forests) to advantage, or air support/artillery or maybe sniping human controllers.  If you ally with them, you get better weapons and armor?  

Chynastan:  what they have is raw numbers, hordes of “bio-motivated” wild-eyed assaulters, engaging this faction might feel most like zombies or like vermintide or deep rock.  Maybe their troops are backed up by air or arty support (they don’t care about danger-close risk so much)?  If you ally with them, you get much cheaper “team” options and/or access to air support?

HumaniCo:  Tech billionaire “humanitarian”, obviously doesn’t have his own army but does have huge drone force with coder bosses in command vehicles, mechs? These are more fast moving than heavy, requires more electronic counter measures, hacking and recon vs. heavy ordinance.  If you ally with them you get better tech and money?

Indigenous Forces:  Iron Age, tribal, etc.  The challenge here is how to make them viable against modern forces in a way you can buy into.  Maybe they use trained local animals as part of force (tough bears, falcons can take out drones, etc).  Maybe engagement is sort of Spartan-like (line up as an impenetrable shield wall, archers rain down over walls).  Since they are defending homeland and know territory, maybe big defense and evasion advantages; they strike/ambush and move/disappear.  Not sure how realistic we want to keep things but maybe they have like shaman or can use the resource we’re fighting over in some spiritual way to possess animals or bad guys?  Maybe they have medicinal knowledge?  If you ally with them you get better intel and sort of “safe houses” from which to stage attacks or hide/heal?

I’m wondering if aligning with one faction maybe doesn’t preclude working with others, maybe taking missions for others here and there if they are against a common enemy or at least don’t conflict with your main faction, or using “contacts” or “influence” to tap into the resource/benefit of another faction in a more limited way … unless you make enemies of a faction by fighting against them too much?  At the meta-game level, it might be cool if you could use spies or influence or whatever to bait or motivate a faction to attack another or join you for a mission or somehow help your faction.

<ins>Faction Affinity</ins>

Faction relation is one “economy” dynamic.  We like not having a literal “score” that is visible to the players, but a scoring dynamic in the background that shapes relationship.  We then have the tone or visuals of the avatars representing each faction show you how your relationship is doing.

<ins>Black Market</ins>

I’m starting to like the idea of a blackmarket or other concept to sell loot to help fund other resources, or access resources/tech you don’t get based on whatever faction you ally with.  Also, I am thinking of paying or bribing factions to cooperate or share resources.  So, we need an ‘economy’ for that.  Could be “influence” vs cash, but cash feels more real and gives us a more literal way to represent how “expensive” various resources arel.  Feels like a mercenary company would very likely use a black market to get gear since they are not a state-sponsored crew.
