Skill Trees

Lingo (x 4 faction-specific languages) passive
L1 - Elementary.  Dialogue with faction members will be ~33% understood.  A few keywords.
L2 - Proficient.  Roughly ~66% understood.  Majority of words in enough ‘order’ to make sense.
L3 - Fluent.  ~100% understood with more ability to sense context or body language.

Reading People passive
L1 - Read body language to interpret if someone is aggressive/friendly toward team
L2 - Read facial expression and body language to interpret if someone is likely lying
L3 - Strong intuition for what interrogation tactic is likely to be successful

Interrogation active
L1 - Interviewer.  Unlocks the interrogation minigame with no buffs/debuffs.
L2 - Smooth talker.  Less score penalty for wrong tactics.
L3 - Keen Observer.  Quicker identification of right tactic(s) … requires fewer clicks/less experimentation.

Hack (could be two separate skills for hacking doors, etc vs computer systems) active
L1 - Unlocks the hack minigame with no buffs/debuffs.
L2 - Can navigate in the system “faster” … translates to gets more time to solve.
L3 - Can remain undetected even if very near security AI … translates to their detection radius is smaller.

Decipher (x4 faction-specific ciphers) active
L1 - Unlocks the decipher minigame with no buffs/debuffs.
L2 - Clues to the decode can sometimes be interpreted
L3 - Previous success means more letters/symbols are pre-filled

To avoid over-mini-game, maybe as you level up a skill you can “auto resolve” lower level mini games.  Maybe you risk not getting the “full” or best outcome but you can avoid some tedium.

In-game Vignettes for Intel-related skills:

Opie the Operator and his team come across a couple of locals gathered outside a shop in a village and decide to talk to them to see what can be learned.  Opie already has the local language as a (passive) skill.  Opie attempts to speak to them but they are resistant because their alliance level with this faction is low.  Opie offers resources (candy bar, ammo, med pack) to friendly them up (but that comes out of in-mission supply).  Locals are now willing to engage in convo.  With extra training at basecamp he’s a level 2 linguist and is now able to understand more than just a few key words.  They learn from the local that the United Alliance faction is active in this area, very strongly equipped and the team should leave quickly for safety.  But, Opie and team aren’t sure they want to take this at face value.  So, Opie decides to use his Interrogation (active) skill (launching persuasion mini game).  If he fails the mini game, it will negatively impact faction alliance.  He experiments briefly with Empathy, Coercion, Inspiration and Bribery modes (by clicking each tactic) while reading the local’s reaction and finds the right tactic and then applies that aggressively (by clicking super fast in that tactic) to unlock much more intel from the contact.  The team learns the locals in the area are reluctantly cooperating with the United Alliance to provide safe passage for a supply convo on a nearby highway, which the team can now choose to target.  EDIT: Maybe the zone lights up or turns green after a few clicks in the right tactic, your score is based on how many clicks in the right tactic in the time allowed.  If the dynamic shifts and a new tactic is required the zone dims and you have to find the next right one, and start clicking.  All clicks in the wrong zones subtract from score.

The team has penetrated unseen into the safe house and gotten Cody the Coder to the HVT’s laptop reportedly stashed here.  But, of course, it’s got a password on it.  To get the files off the machine, he’s going to have to hack through the security (launching hack mini-game).  He is presented with a mini maze to get to an unlock symbol but in this maze are also security AI roaming (think Pacman).  He has to solve the maze within time without being caught/detected by the roaming cyber security.  Unfortunately, Cody fails.  Not only does he not gain access, he fails so poorly that he trips the more advanced anti-hack measures this particular faction has, which triggers a signal to the enemy about the location of the attempted hack.  They won’t be getting the intel this night.  Instead, they now have to either stealthily escape or prepare to defend an attack. 
- Have mazes randomly generated
- ‘Dots’ that tell you if you’ve already been there
- Fog of war or small aperture so you can’t see the whole maze

*****

Luckily in a later mission, the team does bring back a set of files they found in mission for Cody to decode.  To break the code for this faction and understand the intel they have recovered, Cody is presented with seven symbols to solve for (think Hangman or Wheel of Fortune).  Cody does not know the native language of the faction that held this intel, but fortunately they have Opie so Cody starts the codebreak with some clue.  Opie says “This kinda seems like gobbledygook but there’s some reference to dead poets, whatever that means”.  Cody can risk testing a few letters (think buying a vowel) to see if he can get enough to work with to decipher but each failed attempt to decode symbols reduces the fidelity of the intel if/when it is decoded (think redacted words or letters are).  After some wrong and right guesses he now has two of the seven symbols decoded … an “i” and a “t”.  Putting that together with the Opie clue he is about to guess Whitman, after poet Walt Whitman.  But, he takes the risk of one more decipher guess and correctly gets an “o”.  Then it’s clear, Dead Poet’s “Society” … one of 1989’s biggest movies.  What comes up on screen is a blueprint for the enemy’s drones.  Some of the component/resource details are redacted (bc of the failed guesses) but they now have most of what they need for their faction to start producing drones as well.
- Each keyboard stroke counts as a guess
- Translating in English 1 to 1
- Presented a set of symbols which = a word or phrase
- If some known, those are translated for you
- You have a set number of guesses to solve the remainder
- Either you get it right and see the entire intel revealed or level of failure determine how much of the intel is revealed (masked, blank, something)

(The idea is that these can be very easy in the beginning and get harder or that you have to solve several of them in a row to decipher harder levels.  The other idea is each faction would have a different decoding minigame, all similar in the sense that you are decoding symbols or doing word scrambles, but a little bit different flavor to keep it from getting too routine.  Lastly, an idea is once you solve any faction’s code once, if you don’t like playing the minigame, you can use your time at base to have the game auto-resolve for you, but it takes more “time at base” and the fidelity of intel will be lower).

**Earlier Notes**

Skills and Game Implications

In game intel resource gathering:  documents, maps, thumbdrives, ID cards on enemy (for access), interact with locals

In-mission mini-games: “hacking” computer, hacking electronic door access, safe cracking, HUMINT with locals

Base mini-games: deciphering intel, interrogating captives

Game implications of intel could be more detailed maps, locations of resources, identity of spies/collaborators, unlocks support/reinforcement, news of other factions fighting/conditions to use to manipulate alliances, detail on enemy weapons/strengths/weaknesses, routes of enemy transports/resources to avoid or target, location of HVTs, probability of “events” happening 

SKILLS:  
  
TERP.  Linguist, culture knowledge, interrogation.  Without it, talking to locals for intel, at best, reveals very broken English that yields low detail.  Also captured intel will reveal much less without language knowledge.  Start game knowing 1 faction’s.  Can invest “research” time at base to learn more languages throughout the game.

Persuasion mini-game can be used for high-value local interactions in mission and interrogation of captives at base.  A wheel with 4 zones: empathy (think of your family…), coercion (threats, discomfort), Inspiration (promises, appeal to higher principles), Money (flat-out bribery).  Each subject will respond to different interrogation approaches or combination.  Hover or click on approach and monitor some kind of indicator of how subject is responding (giving intel, getting pissed, whatever).  Quickly adjust approach (change hover/click) to find best response.  If subject spends too much time in negative response modes, interrogation fails.  Level of intel recovered or alliance established based on how quickly you find / how long you maintain the “right” approach.

CODE-BREAKER:  Trying not to make it too cliche to have the usual hacker, but seems necessary.  Hacker of computers, doors or security systems in mission.  Breaker of ciphers to interpret intel from docs, maps or SIGINT.

In-mission hack mini-game for computers or doors.  You have to “route” your hack successfully though a mini-maze?  Seems like this has to be a pass/fail mini-game vs. a better-score=better-results.

At-base cipher mini-game.  We assume most intel/comms are encoded or using some sort of cipher for security.  This is a classic case of figuring out the cipher to get useful intel from captured docs/thumbdrives/etc.  Could be simple word scrambles or there are several known and relatively simple ciphers on the interwebs we can use for either increasing difficulty or because different factions use different ciphers.  This is a case where the better/faster you decode, the more details revealed in the intel.
