Interpreter

TERP.  Linguist, culture knowledge, interrogation.  Without it, talking to locals for intel, at best, reveals very broken English that yields low detail.  Also captured intel will reveal much less without language knowledge.  Start game knowing 1 faction’s.  Can invest “research” time at base to learn more languages throughout the game.  
	1. Persuasion mini-game can be used for high-value local interactions in mission and interrogation of captives at base.  A wheel with 4 zones: empathy (think of your family…), coercion (threats, discomfort), Inspiration (promises, appeal to higher principles), Money (flat-out bribery).  Each subject will respond to different interrogation approaches or combination.  Hover or click on approach and monitor some kind of indicator of how subject is responding (giving intel, getting pissed, whatever).  Quickly adjust approach (change hover/click) to find best response.  If subject spends too much time in negative response modes, interrogation fails.  Level of intel recovered or alliance established based on how quickly you find / how long you maintain the “right” approach.

		2. In base - captive interrogation (priority 1)
			1. Better outcomes improve quality and amount of intel
		3. FPS - Location of resource, map details, faction information, HVT location
