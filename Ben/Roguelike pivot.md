I would like to propose a different option for the metagame that makes use of roguelike design elements. From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike):

Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a style of role-playing game traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character.

Some examples of games with roguelike elements are:

- Vermintide 2’s Chaos Wastes mode    
- Stolen Realm’s Rogue mode
- FTL
- Slay the Spire

A given playthrough or “run” of a roguelike will generally play very differently from previous runs because of how much of what happens is procedurally generated. This generally leads to high replayability. The gamer generally has less control over the build of their character than a normal RPG
# Game Flow

Game run begins with each player playing a base level mercenary with no upgrades. Maybe they choose one of a few different starter kits that define their starting weapon.

Missions are laid out on a map that allows the group to pick and choose missions based on what kinds of rewards they want, similar to Vermintide 2’s Chaos Wastes mode.

Missions are laid out in a tree structure allowing the group to navigate through to the end. From any given node there could be 2 to 3 options of which node to progress to.

Each node on the map is an FPS encounter. Each encounter could have additional storytelling sections with dialog options that could dictate some of the parameters of the mission.

Example: The group chooses the next mission and before the FPS map loads a short dialog pops up with one of the factions offering the group extra money if they manage to extract a specific hostage. If the group decides to do this an additional goal is added to the encounter that gives the group additional reward for succeeding (and maybe punishment for failing).

After each encounter the group is rewarded with the encounter specific rewards. These might come in a few different categories like equipment, money, intelligence or faction influence. In addition to the encounter specific reward(s), each surviving member of the group gains an experience point they can use to improve their character. Actually I think that presenting the player with 3 different character improvements to choose from might fit more closely with the procedural nature of a roguelike.

If a member of the group dies then they lose their character but stay in the group, being assigned a fresh character for which they choose a new starting kit.

The run ends successfully when the encounter at the last node is completed.
# Possible Pitfalls

1. Advancement Pace and Efficacy - Unlike a normal RPG, character advancement is limited to a single run. This means that we should accelerate the pace of advancement considerably.
	1. Each level of advancement should feel like a significant upgrade or allow the player to play in a way not previously possible.
	2. There needs to be a wide variety of upgrades that create a very different play. This is in contrast to most low-speed tactical shooters where the player is able to consider their loadout carefully and the individual character attributes do not have a significant effect on how they play the game. 
# Benefits of Switching

Moving to this sort of structure
