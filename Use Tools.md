Use Tools

Vignette 1: The broken door
The squad is attempting to infiltrate a building, all but one entrance is heavily guarded and that one has a broken door handle/lock.  Luckily, Troy (our trusty mechanic) brought along his toolkit.  With the squad covering, he works to put the door handle/lock back together.

Mini game - **Using tools** (pliers, welding torch, screw driver) repair each damaged piece.
1. Screw driver to reattach the base plate to the door
2. Welding torch to cut off a piece of shrapnel lodged in the handle mechanism
3. Pliers to re-align the handle to the correct position

Once completed, the door is now functional, but is it locked?

Vignette 2: Defensive position
Our sector is being attacked!  The team is responding to an assault and the turret gun is non-operational.  We're not sure we can hold them off without the additional firepower.  While the squad is laying down cover fire, Troy is looking for the issue and repairing the turret.

Mini-game - Find the issue and repair it
1. A 3 dimensional view of the turret, user can rotate in any direction
2. 2 possible issues
	1. Broken part - is a different color
		1. Can repair with the correct tool
			1. bent - pliers
			2. detached (minor) - screw driver
			3. detached (major) - welding torch
	2. Missing part - ghost image of the part
		1. Use parts gathered on the battlefield to replace
		2. Attempt a bypass?
3. 3 outcomes
	1. Fixed!  Turret works
	2. Partial fix - turret works for a short period of time
	3. Failure! Turret is non-operational

Vignette 3: The Lock
The squad just crushed a factions resistance in sector 5 and is picking through the bodies, and buildings.  So much good stuff, but what Troy really needs is a new welding torch.  Opening drawers and boxes he discovers a brand-new 'scorcher' welding torch case, but it's locked up!  

Mini-game - Break in, or finesse it
1. Open the lock by:
	1. Forcing it with a crowbar
		1. potentially destroys/damages the item
	2. Dismantle the lock
		1. Using the right tools, remove each piece of the locking mechanism in the correct order
			1. If success - the lock opens
			2. If fail - the lock is destroyed and can only be opened by crowbar
