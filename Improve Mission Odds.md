Dev Mode Concept
- Platformer
- Multiple Bots competing for resources
	- Each represents another faction, whatever they capture improves their power/standing/story arch
	- Each bot has a specific resource they want - indicated at the beginning
	- End of mini-game could trade/give resource - Could use to improve other faction relations
- Jobboard.com bureaucracy navigation
- Items captured in platformer translate to in-FPS items/objectives
	- Medivac (someone with Treat Wounds could use)
	- Key-card (makes a door openable without hack)

Commander Cletus leaves Tuesday’s mission briefing, tablet in hand. As he enters his office, he places the tablet on his desk, lights a cigar and sits down. Before him, on the tablet’s screen, is a list of mission orders. As usual, the fucking brass have set their sights too goddamn high. What single squad could accomplish all this shit in one go? Luckily Cletus has learned that he can keep his ass out of the hot seat if he can manage to pull off at least 3 of the goals assigned. Come to think of it, has their list ever consisted of more or less than 6 objectives? Whatever, not worth wasting the time thinking about what those pricks are thinking. Focus on what you CAN get done, forget the rest.

Cletus initiates a macro, cleverly designed by one of his best operatives. The tablet screen changes as the new program spins up, and he is met with a myriad of options for resource acquisition and allocation. Oddly enough, this was one of his favorite tasks. Most people find this part of the job tedious. But for Cletus, it’s almost like a game! He’s always had a fantastic imagination. Even as an adult, he can always find ways to make the mundane chores in his life just a little more pleasant.

As he sends out requests, leverages bargaining chips with other commanders and snags unallocated ordinance, he imagines that he’s traversing a vast ladder and platform system. Jumping to nab a choice piece of equipment before one of his counterparts gets there first. Sliding under a closing security door to snag that scandalous DM commander Shultz was trying to send to his mistress. “Hah! You’ll have to pay big time for this Shultzy. If you don’t want the missus to see this, you’re going to need to cough up that stack of security spikes you’ve been hoarding”. Cletus imagines jumping, climbing and diving his way through the vast bureaucratic framework. Dodging incoming attacks from opposing commanders, and gobbling up as much as he can. 

- I imagine this a lot like a side scrolling run and gun, with ladders and doorways. Think Rolling Thunder, only maybe a bit more vertical play, and maybe less polished. Maybe more like 8-bit gaming than 16.
    
- Objectives like Shultz's DM would be rare, and have a limited window for access
    
- Game mode is on a timer. The "Work Day" time period.
    

Before he realizes it, the work day is almost at an end. The clock at the top of his screen is ticking down, and he needs to scramble to gather whatever else he can. Once completed, his program closes out, and he’s left staring at his list of objectives again. Only now, thanks to his cleverly hacked tablet, the missions present in a completely new way.

Fucking AI man, I love this shit! 3 different colors of text show before him, Green, Yellow and Red. Based on what resources he was able to acquire today, and the composition of his team, his tablet had conveniently organized his mission objectives by likelihood of success. Well, it’s no surprise that trying to take the water filtration building is sitting at the bottom. The solid red text shines up at him, challengingly. If I could just crack that nut, the brass would be sure to increase our budget and access to resources for the next mission handsomely. If he ever found out which Op botched the hack of the biometric system in Sheridan last week, he’d have his nuts in a vice. That would have made gathering the tech he needed easier today. That treatment plant objective might have even shown up green this week. Who knows, maybe an 80% chance of success. But, then it wouldn’t reward so handsomely if completed, so there’s that.

Cletus has found that the key is to pick the right balance. Aim too high and fail, that will just make next week even harder. The other key is to check for mission success multipliers listed under each objective's success rate. Securing the launch codes from data center got a 20% boost, thanks to those security spikes I managed to take off of old Shultzy.

Cletus checks the boxes next to 3 objectives he wants to set as primary, and hits the execute command. The mission parameters and objective list will then be sent to all active squad members at 0500 tomorrow morning, 1 hour before briefing. Snuffing out his cigar, Cletus gathers up his belongings and shuts the office light off on his way out.
