Medic

Vignette 1:
Troy has clumsily hurt himself with a welder and needs first aid. Our intrepid medic Holly knows first aid and is carrying some helpful bandages and pain killers. Grabbing the injured arm she uses an alcohol wipe to clean the wound. Troy winces and the arm moves making it harder to treat. Holly snaps "hold still" and begins wrapping a bandage. She can tell Troy to "turn over" if she wants to see how it's looking on the other side. A quick "swallow this" takes care of the pain killer. If done well Troy is back in business, if not then future welding is going to be a lot more difficult.
