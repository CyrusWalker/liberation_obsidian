In game intel resource gathering:  documents, maps, thumbdrives, ID cards on enemy (for access), interact with locals In-mission mini-games: “hacking” computer, hacking electronic door access, safe cracking, HUMINT with localsBase mini-games: deciphering intel, interrogating captivesGame implications of intel could be more detailed maps, locations of resources, identity of spies/collaborators, unlocks support/reinforcement, news of other factions fighting/conditions to use to manipulate alliances, detail on enemy weapons/strengths/weaknesses, routes of enemy transports/resources to avoid or target, location of HVTs, probability of “events” happening

TERP.  Linguist, culture knowledge, interrogation.  Without it, talking to locals for intel, at best, reveals very broken English that yields low detail.  Also captured intel will reveal much less without language knowledge.  Start game knowing 1 faction’s.  Can invest “research” time at base to learn more languages throughout the game.  
	1. Persuasion mini-game can be used for high-value local interactions in mission and interrogation of captives at base.  A wheel with 4 zones: empathy (think of your family…), coercion (threats, discomfort), Inspiration (promises, appeal to higher principles), Money (flat-out bribery).  Each subject will respond to different interrogation approaches or combination.  Hover or click on approach and monitor some kind of indicator of how subject is responding (giving intel, getting pissed, whatever).  Quickly adjust approach (change hover/click) to find best response.  If subject spends too much time in negative response modes, interrogation fails.  Level of intel recovered or alliance established based on how quickly you find / how long you maintain the “right” approach.
		1. Visual to show if the approach is working or not
			1. Animation of NPS
			2. Meter
		2. In base - captive interrogation (priority 1)
			1. Better outcomes improve quality and amount of intel
		3. FPS - Location of resource, map details, faction information, HVT location
			1. Better outcomes improve quality and amount of intel

CODE-BREAKER:  Trying not to make it too cliche to have the usual hacker, but seems necessary.  Hacker of computers, doors or security systems in mission.  Breaker of ciphers to interpret intel from docs, maps or SIGINT.  In-mission hack mini-game for computers or doors.  You have to “route” your hack successfully though a mini-maze?  Seems like this has to be a pass/fail mini-game vs. a better-score=better-results.  At-base cipher mini-game.  We assume most intel/comms are encoded or using some sort of cipher for security.  This is a classic case of figuring out the cipher to get useful intel from captured docs/thumbdrives/etc.  Could be simple word scrambles or there are several known and relatively simple ciphers on the interwebs we can use for either increasing difficulty or because different factions use different ciphers.  This is a case where the better/faster you decode, the more details revealed in the intel.
1. At base: Each faction would have their own cypher, can find them/pieces of them
	1. Once you have the cypher you can use it to "translate" intel
		1. Same as above (HVT location, map details, etc.)
2. FPS: route your hack!
	1. Logo style?
	2. Timed
	3. Failure keeps locked and cannot be redone
	4. Pass opens the door
		1. Could have a 3rd level for disarming alarm?
