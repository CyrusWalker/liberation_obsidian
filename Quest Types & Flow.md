Quest Types:

As one example model, Battletech features a merc company structure, factions and faction affinity, hiring mercs and a marketplace/black market economy.  Missions work like a job board — you just take whatever missions you want based on combat type, loot, travel/proximity or what it does for faction affinity.  

But, in our case, I think the idea is we are hired by a particular faction.  So, many of our jobs will come as “orders” from our faction contact, essentially our handler, either via in-person meetings or via radio/computer transmission with mission details.  Others may emerge based on overall faction dynamics or as a side-effect of missions.

 Sources:
- Assigned by boss faction
- Unlocked by event/contact in mission
- Unlocked via intelligence discoveries or decoding
- Offered by other factions (enemy of my enemy is my friend)

Example Scenario of “Daisy Chain” or Branching Quests:

‘Merica Mercs is approached by their handler Chelsea to take on a mission that will move their faction’s agenda forward.  They are to kill \(\$\$) or capture (\$\$\$) an engineer from the HumaniCo faction who is responsible for the maintenance and software updates of a fleet of drones in the region.  Chelsea sends what intel and photos they have via secure modem.  But, the faction HQ has no idea where the engineer is or what enemy unit he will next be servicing.  

So, ‘Merica Mercs is advised they have two potential paths: (a) hack a computer or interrogate a person at the HumaniCo FOB the engineer last serviced and hope there is some intel on his path, route or itinerary that would lead us to his next stop or (b) find and interrogate Shimone, a female local from a village the engineer appears to visit with some frequency for “romantic” reasons.

The team chooses (b), infils near the village, captures and interrogates a resistant villager to get the location of the Shimone.  They take Shimone’s apartment building without resistance and find Shimone only too willing to share intel.  She has only been “cooperating” with the engineer out of fear.  She loathes him.  The team now knows the engineer varies his route to some degree but he said something about the beach that makes Shimone “pretty sure” which location is his next stop in the coming few days.  The team has enough to locate the enemy FOB and set up to kill or capture.  But, Shimone also shares that their village fighters are about to attack a lightly armed UA supply convoy and that – if the merc company could spare a couple of trained fighters to assist – they would share some of the loot and be ever so grateful when future information became available.  

The company annoints two members to assist (which plays out as a separate mission) and calls on others at base to meet them at the LZ near the target location.  They pick a spot to set up the ambush and wait.  The team spots HumaniCo vehicles approaching and the team’s recon spotter confirms – based on photos Chelsea the Handler shared –  the engineer is in the second vehicle.  But, the convoy is supported by drone air support, so the team triggers the ambush early before they are spotted.  The resistance is more effective than otherwise expected because of the air support and target spotting.  The team cannot overwhelm the enemy troops and drone combination after two team members are wounded, but is able to confirm a sniper kill of the engineer.  One wounded member is able to limp to the extraction but the other appears unconscious and cannot safely be recovered.

The team calls in the exfil chopper they paid handsomely for on the black market.  They report the neutralization of the engineer to Chelsea, who is disappointed they were not able to capture him for intel but pays them just the same.  She is able to share where the remnants of the HumaniCo unit most likely went.  

The team can now decide whether to take on a mission on their own dime to recover their downed man.  But they have to do it as their next mission or surely the team mate will either be dead from his injuries or interrogated to death.

Meanwhile the team conducting the  Indig Support mission reports total success and the recovery of ammo and medical gear from the convoy ambush.
