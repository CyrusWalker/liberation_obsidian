# World Thoughts

The islands are off the coast of a larger country north of Scandinavia (visually think Faroe islands), location think Barent Sea.  1 real town (<1000 people) with a road from the harbor where they get basic supplies.  3-4k total population across the entire archipelago.  Small warehouses, communication hub, commercial center for bringing in goods, services (Safe zone).  Black market contact here, faction reps.  Commercially they have herd animals (finest wool on earth), Mining of ore (special properties).  The locals use the ore dust in creating paint that happens to absorb UV light in a way that heats their houses, makes their clothes more thermally effective, etc.

The ore is the thing that brings the team in as someone is trying to secure it.  They were mining it by hand but wanted to expand so they brought in a 3rd party mining outfit that leaked the information out.  This is what brought about the conflict.  When you get there they have options for bases (cost point and capability difference) or they give you a free space but it’s only short-term.

Archipelago
- Variability in environs
- Snowy mountains
- Pine/Fir
- Forest
- Tundra
	- Geothermal vents
	- Caves where the spores grow
- Natural harbor/bay
- Roads vs animal trails
	- Most islands wouldn’t have real roads, dirt paths etc.
- Volcano
	- Not on the main island
- Rivers/Lakes
- No Landing strip
	- Seaplane

Mission Concepts
- Investigate a giant crate

When not controlling a character, have an Ops screen
- Map with Points of interest
	- Collaboration - Can draw on?
	- Mission selection - ranked choice voting?
- People
	- can be assigned to teams/missions
	-   
- Economy - summary, clickable to see details
- Comms
- Time controller (start, stop, speed)
	- If an active mission is happening, cannot change time
	- No concurrent combats
### Items to Discuss:
Town is a 3d representation.  When the players enter, the points of interest are indicated and the user can select them directly rather than walking around.
- Could use Darklands style interrupts? Factions that want to talk to you will interrupt, possibly attack if they hate you?
### Gameplay Loop

		- Each player has their own inventory pool (weapons, mods, ammo, armor)
		- Shared money to equip skill based items or are those items automatically equipped and covered in the pay?
		- They start with an item, but gets consumed as used
			- Keep costs small to keep this from being prohibitive
### Character creation
- Merc creation/hiring
	- All mercs randomly generated
	- Initial roster set by each VC selecting their preferred configuration, then all members vote (ranked choice) and the outcome is handled by the calculator
	- Mercs must travel to our base from wherever they are (lag time)
- When starting do we each pick a merc or create a character?
	- Pool of money to spend on creation or selection, shared?
	- Max players/NPCs 8 (If 8 players, no NPCs to start)
		- Character creation for NPC and PC should be same
			- Option 3: all Mercs are randomly generated
				- Are we setting stats directly?  Pre-defined? Obfuscating?
				- PC Skills set directly or randomly assigned?
- Need a system behind the scene calculates the value of a character
	- Skills
	- Stats
	- Value should include upfront cost and salary
		- Salary increases as characters improve
		- Time box for when contract needs renewal
	- How often do you pay/fire/hire?
		- Have on retainer
		- Cost to put them in the field
- Voices?
	- Per character?
		- Lots of work
	- Pre-set Voice types (4 total, 8 total, etc.)
	- Dialogue written not spoken
### Squads
- Formed as semi-permanent unit (until they return to base)
- VC hires his merc for the length of their deployment and is responsible for that mercs hazard pay throughout
	- Cost accrues daily and is paid upon mercs return to base
	- Equipping the merc is the responsibility of the employing player
- When the squad returns, the contract completes and the merc goes back into the pool
	- Does the equipment stay with the merc or revert to the player? Merc
-   
### Economy
- Income (how to achieve scarcity)
	- Individual $ vs Group $
		- Players represent the mercenary management and vote with their $
		- Group money is set aside for merc maintenance, and buying new capabilities (transportation, improved facilities, hiring mercs)
			- Game start designate a % off income that goes into the company
			- Remaining is individual
	- Starting contract
