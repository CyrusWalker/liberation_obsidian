We’re only on our third excursion, very early in our careers as liberators. So far, Prioritizing the Siege, and Jury-rigging skills, my focus is to deploy special equipment in the field to overcome particularly fortified defenses.

Our next mission is the assault of an isolated and derelict Estate, located at the end of a side road. Cover is less than sparse, and a suspicious glint on the roof shed has our team worried. Could that be a sniper? An enemy we haven’t encountered yet… Let’s not take any chances. 

It’s my time to shine. I select my inventory item “SteelBarrow” that I cobbled together from machine parts and metal scraps during the action phase. I begin deploying it well out of range. A progress bar ticks up along with our nervous anticipation.

What I’ve constructed is our shabby but serviceable mobile armored cover: a Cart festooned with junk. It’s tall and wide and tall enough to shelter about 4 of us but we have to run behind this zero seater. I grab the handles and push it onto the muddy path and into the open.

Progress is slow as gunshots ring out from far beyond our ability to counter. We are taking sniper fire! The steelbarrow is holding, but taking steady damage. Can’t this thing go any faster? Right! My strength is low! Why am I pushing this thing? Get this thing moving Skathe!

One perilous minute later, we have fought off a wave of grunts sent to stop us. We could take a few careful shots between the armor plates of the steelbarrow but mostly just blasted the assholes as they tried to flank.

The snipers have completely trashed my cart as we reach the walls of the main building. Under the line of sight of the snipers, we are still not in the clear. Targets are peeking out of windows and leaning over the roof to finish us. We have to make a mad scramble around to a less hot side of the building where, if we’re lucky I will have time to assemble this stack of scrap wood into a ladder!
